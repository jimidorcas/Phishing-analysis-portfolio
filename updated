# 📧 Phishing Analysis Portfolio

## 📌 Overview
This project demonstrates my ability to analyse phishing emails using Python, extract **Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)**, and identify attacker patterns.  
I used open-source phishing datasets and sample `.eml` files, then wrote Python scripts to parse, analyse, and visualise phishing techniques.

This repo will be updated as the project progresses:
- ✅ Email header extraction  
- ✅ URL parsing & domain checks  
- ⏳ Visualisations (common domains, suspicious TLDs)  
- ⏳ Report with findings & screenshots  

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Parse phishing email headers (From, Reply-To, Subject).  
- Extract URLs and flag red flags (IP-based, typosquatting, suspicious TLDs).  
- Automate detection using Python scripts.  
- Visualise phishing trends with charts.  
- Produce a short findings report.

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
- Python 3  
- `email` (header parsing)  
- `re` (regex for URLs)  
- `tldextract` (domain analysis)  
- `pandas`, `matplotlib` (data visualisation – coming soon)
